a route is a mapping of URL patterns to request handlers

we are in __init__.py of routes !

# redirect is important after a form
# redirect is also important for marking an article as read... when they click an article
# they would be redirected to a URL that marks the article as read and then to
# the article

# request is a global that stores some state about the request
# for example it stores the form values ...
from flask import redirect, request


you have to make sure that the routes are accessed by the run.py file!
you do this by importing the routes module(folder).
