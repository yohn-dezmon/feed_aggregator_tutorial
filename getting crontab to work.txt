Getting crontab to work... I'm very close in that it's rather simple and I understand 
how to use it... I'm not sure if the import x statements work 

OK https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48597496/python-script-stops-at-import-statement-when-script-is-run-as-cronjob

cron runs processes with a different environment than that of your terminal! 
To add python to your shell script:
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/script:$PYTHONPATH 

Full path to my file:
/Users/HomeFolder/taskqueue_tut/run.py


Full path to my python (maybe?):
/Users/HomeFolder/.venvs/tentagg/bin/python3

which python will show you the path of your Python binary... 
(tentagg) MacBook-Pro:taskqueue_tut HomeFolder$ which Python
/Users/HomeFolder/.venvs/tentagg/bin/Python

YESS :D

^^ This guy recommends listing the full python path in the crontab statement :D 
(as opposed to just 'python')
