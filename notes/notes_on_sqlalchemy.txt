understanding the execute() function:

To understand execute(), we need to understand the Executable class.
It is a superclass for all "statement" type of objects.
[select(), delete(), update(), insert(), text()]
in simple terms, an Executable is an SQL statement in a python method.
execute() takes the SQL statement and returns query results
[a resultproxy that wraps a DB-API cursor object to provide easier access
to row columns]


Can I perform a mathematical operation in the where clause of the delete method?
from stack overflow the guy recommends that you perform the operation in a
function outside of the query, then put that function in the query :D

def subtract_date(now, date_added):
          return now - date_added


since I defined now before the function, will it know what now is?
I think it will! b/c when you actually call the function, the input IS the variable
it just also is named now in the definition of the function :D
