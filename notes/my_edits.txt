Questions:

1. How do I determine the time frame that this script will run?
- I don't think we've gone over this in the tutorial yet...
- We manually inserted the articles into the DB.

2. Will the articles get replaced every time the script runs, or
will my database keep getting larger with all of the articles I collect?

3. How did the articles get in the DB again?

4. How do I insert articles???? does the 1 source id mean that I'll only insert the article
with that source_id???

5. From the form online, how did I input the rss feed into the db?

Things I'm going to add (or have added) (04/25/2019):

1. delete after x days function [check]
2. CSS to display four boxes [check]
3. a call to insert the articles after the new source has been added in the
/sources route... [check]
4. I want to make use crontab to run, run.py
5. I want to create a file to clear the cache so I don't have to do it manually!
6. Fix the body/article['summary'] such that they don't display any html tags! [check!]

Notes:

app.py connects to the DB.

-How do I delete a source from the DB?
go into mysql db and ... DELETE FROM source WHERE id = 4;

What I've figured out:
1. How to have separate divs containing only the articles from a singular news source
[setting up the __init__.py file route to create a method that inputs this data]

2. Making the CSS such that the boxes show up in a grid pattern.

3. Using jinja2 and python to access the title of the source for the title above the boxes
it turns out each article is within a <> format in a list, but it can be accessed as an
element of a list, i.e. list[0].source.title {{ }}...

Things to modify:
-Make the source insertion be able to handle errors!

-Make a user interface that allows you to delete a source

-Set up crontab to run this automatically daily

-Set up limits to how many new articles can be added, or have the database
start deleting older files articles! :D
* the date_added column for articles is db.DateTime, default=datetime.datetime.utcnow)
https://hartmans.livejournal.com/96592.html
** When you subtract datetime.datetime.utcnow from date_added the result is in the format
of datetime.timedelta().
datetime.timedelta() has the syntax timedelta(days, seconds, microseconds, milliseconds, minutes, hours, weeks)

SO I'M going to make a classmethod function that deletes the articles that have been in the
database for greater than a certain timedelta(day) time by subtracting now from date_added
** OK my formula isn't work, I don't know why yet :( )


-make the css layout better! :D (titles above each box)

-understand how the articles are getting inserted... b/c I only understand
how the sources are getting inserted...
***I forgot that I started to watch the 09 video of the series and
he made the run.py file that iterates over the inserted sources.
