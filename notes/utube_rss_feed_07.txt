Making Templates!

Only the index_get() and sources_get() of __init__.py
need templates b/c the read_article_get just redirects the
application to the article webpage.


If you open up the / page, click on a link, return to the webpage
then reload the page, it will cause the item to disappear because its value for
read in the db has changed from no to yes.
