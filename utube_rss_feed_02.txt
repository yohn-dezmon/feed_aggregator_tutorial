Installing MySQL...

He's doing this in Ubuntu... So I will to ! uhh fuck.

NVM I'm going to download MariaDB with Homebrew...
but first I need to install HomeBrew...

https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/homebrew-install-use
Homebrew is a 'package manager'
a package manager is a tool which automates the process of installing, updating, and removing
packages.

pip is also a package manager.
conda also has package manager functionality (but does other things too).


To install something with homebrew:
brew install something

to unistall a package
brew rm something

Installing MariaDB on a mac:
https://www.javatpoint.com/how-to-install-mariadb-on-mac

* I didn't install MariaDB or HomeBrew into 'tentagg' virtual environment...

$ brew install mariadb
$ brew services start mariadb

# what it outputs after you run that ^

MySQL is configured to only allow connections from localhost by default

To connect:
    mysql -uroot

To have launchd start mariadb now and restart at login:
  brew services start mariadb
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:

  mysql.server start

* why use mysql_secure_installation???
-It is available on Unix systems (which mac OS is ..)
You can set a password for root accounts.
You can remove root accounts that are accessible from outside the local host.
You can remove anonymous-user accounts.
You can remove the test database, which by default can be accessed by anonymous users.

I'm getting the error 2002 (HY000) which I don't understand why... So I'm going to skip this fucking step...

uh.... this worked! $ mysql -u root

Post Error Davy:

$ sudo mysql_secure_installation

# the next step enables the password! :D
$ sudo mysql -u root -p

# use the mysql table! :D
MariaDB [(none)]> use mysql;


MariaDB [mysql]> update user set plugin='mysql_native_password' where user='root';

# what does this do?
MariaDB [mysql]> flush privileges;

MariaDB [mysql]> quit;

SQLALCHEMY is an object relational mapper!
It allows us to write python code that represents our model and interaction with the model
w/o haveing to write raw SQL code.

we could always use Postgres if we didn't like MySQL..


we're going to use flask-SQLalchemy

WE just installed:
flask
flask_sqlalchemy
sqlalchemy

with pip3 ...
 I MAY HAVE NEEDED TO BE IN SUDO WHEN DOING THIS... FUCK.
pip install PyMySQL

$ mysql -u root -p
MariaDB [(none)]> create database feedreader;
MariaDB [(none)]> exit;
