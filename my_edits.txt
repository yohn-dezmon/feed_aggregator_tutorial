Questions:

1. How do I determine the time frame that this script will run?
- I don't think we've gone over this in the tutorial yet...
- We manually inserted the articles into the DB.

2. Will the articles get replaced every time the script runs, or
will my database keep getting larger with all of the articles I collect?

3. How did the articles get in the DB again?

4. How do I insert articles???? does the 1 source id mean that I'll only insert the article
with that source_id???

5. From the form online, how did I input the rss feed into the db?

Notes:

app.py connects to the DB.
