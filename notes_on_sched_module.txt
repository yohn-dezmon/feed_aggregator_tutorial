the sched module implements a generic event scheduler for running tasks
at specific times.

the scheduler class uses a 'time' function to determine what time it is
and a 'delay' function to determine how long to wati.

time.time() >>> should return the current time.


----
RUNNING EVENTS WITH A DELAY:

Events can be scheduled to run after a delay, or at a specific time
to schedule them with a delay, use the enter() method ! :D
4 arguments
* a number representing the delay
* a priority value
* the function to call
* a tuple of arguments for the function (?)
