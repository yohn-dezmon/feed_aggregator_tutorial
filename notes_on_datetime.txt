OK problem from above that I just realized!

subtracting the date_addded from a datetime object results in
datetime.timedelta(10, 11446, 404858)

But I need to compare the days from that thing to the time_diff which prints as
1 day, 0:00:00

subtracting two datetime.datetime.utcnow()'s  resulted in
-1 day, 23:59:43.039155

how to extract the elements of the time delta?

86,400 seconds in a day...

so take the result of the subtraction formula, set it equal to a variable
from that variable do
variable.days()


------

>>> for article in query.all():
...     date_added = article.date_added
...     def subtract_date(now, date_added):
...             timedelt = now - date_added

...             return timedelt.days
...     now = datetime.datetime.utcnow()
...     now_days = now.days
...     subtract_date(now_days, date_added)
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 7, in <module>
AttributeError: 'datetime.datetime' object has no attribute 'days'

hmmm ok so you can obvisouly only use .days following timedelta()

so how do I extract days from datetime.datetime?

I think I need to use .day instead of .days

---

>>> for article in query.all():
...     date_added = article.date_added
...     def subtract_date(now, date_added):
...             timedelt = now - date_added
...             return timedelt.days
...     now = datetime.datetime.utcnow()
...     now_day = now.day
...     subtract_date(now_day, date_added)
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 8, in <module>
  File "<stdin>", line 4, in subtract_date
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'int' and 'datetime.datetime'

---

alright so this means that now_day is 'int' and date_added is datetime.datetime
I KNOW WHAT I NEED TO DO
converte date_added into .day :D

----

>>> for article in query.all():
...     date_added = article.date_added
...     def subtract_date(now, date_added):
...             return now - date_added
...     now = datetime.datetime.utcnow()
...     now_day = now.day
...     date_added_day = date_added.day
...
...     subtract_date(now_day, date_added_day)

----
^^ This fucking worked! :D

OK now the question is, can I compare the result of the subtract_date function
to either a timedelta value or a timedelta().days value?

---
>>> now = datetime.datetime.utcnow()
>>> now_day = now.day
>>> print(type(now_day))
<class 'int'>

----

>>> time_diff = delt_time_diff.days
>>> print(time_diff)
3

>>> type(time_diff)
<class 'int'>

----

ok so given the above two examples I should be able to compare them ! :D

--


if subtract_date(now_day, date_added_day) >= time_diff:

i might use this hold on...

YES I FINALLY GOT IT TO WORK :D :D :D :D :D


Things I had to get right to make this work:

on run.py:
articles.Article.delete_from_db() [correct syntax]
also this had to be within the app context!

on articles.py:
I had to extract the day from the datetime.datetime.utcnow() object !
I did that for both the now variable I made and also for the
date_added variable, which represents the date_added field of the Article
table. the date_added field is in the datetime.datetime.utcnow() format obvs.
I think if you subtract two datetime.datetime.utcnow()'s from eachother you end up
with a datetime.timedelta() object... so taht's what i was using timedelta at first.
[also ntoe that it's datetime.timedelta() not datetime.datetime.timedelta()]
but I ended up needing to extract just the day from timedelta()... and you do that by
timedelta().days
but that ends up being an integer
and subtracting two datetime.datetime.utcnow().day objects from eachother is also an integer
so....
I think i could replace my time_diff_days with just the integer of the days I want to delete after
but w/e.

I used a for loop to access each row in the article table, and called each row 'article'
I accessed the date_added attribute of the Article table by article.date_added
I assigned that to date_added variable, then got the .day component from datetime...

I made a formula that subtracts the now_day from date_added_day

I made a SQLAlchemy delete query using the syntax
d = Article.__table__.delete().where(subtract_date(now_day, date_added_day) >= time_diff)

I'm not exactly sure why I had to use the Article.__table__ instead of just Article.delete()
... maybe I can find out why now..

I included the db.engine.execute(d) within the for loop
also in the where clause I used the subtract_date function just to simplify what I'd have to write

I think the Article.__table__ may relate to class method decorators...

Hmmm what is the static factory method pattern? ? ? ?

ok cool dan bader has a chapter section on static methods yay! :D
